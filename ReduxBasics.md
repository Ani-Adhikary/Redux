<h1>Redux Basics </h1>

<h2>1️⃣ What is Redux? (Core Idea) </h2>

Redux is a predictable state management pattern.

<h3>Key Philosophy </h3>

Single Source of Truth + Unidirectional Data Flow

In simple words:

Your entire app state lives in one place

UI cannot modify state directly

UI sends actions

Actions go through a reducer

Reducer creates a new state

UI updates automatically
